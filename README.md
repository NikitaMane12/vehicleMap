# Vehicle Movement on Map Web Application

This web application visualizes vehicle movement on a map using the Leaflet library. Users can select two points on the map to find the shortest path, with a car marker animating along the route every 200ms. The app also provides route directions, a reset feature for recalculating routes, and a geolocation feature to get your current location.
